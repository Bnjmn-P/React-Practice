      <h2>Research and Development Project</h2>
<p>As part of my final year at Auckland University of Technology (AUT), I am part of a team tasked with examining how the faculty manages its academic courses. We had two semesters to complete this task. We worked together to figure out our roles and how we'd go about our research. We learned about our clients' needs and presented a plan for how we'd approach the project and what results they could expect.</p>
<p>To get the job done effectively, we decided to use an agile method called Scrum, which is a structured way of working together. I was chosen to be Scrum master and lead this process, based on my prior experience in a similar role. This meant I organized daily check-ins, explained our working methods, kept everyone up to date, tracked our progress, and helped solve any problems that came up.</p>
<p>Our clients wanted us to thoroughly examine the current system, finding places where we could use automation or make things work more efficiently. They also wanted us to suggest possible new features that another team could add later. To do this, we first identified all the important people and users of any software currently in use. We talked to them to understand what they put into the system, what they did with it, and what came out of it. This gave us both a broad overview and a detailed look at how the courses were being managed. We summarized all these processes in documents and diagrams, such as UML and use case diagrams.</p>
<p>We used a method called business process models to help us organize and understand how everything fit together. We kept in close touch with the clients to make sure our project was on the right path and meeting their expectations. Once they were sure we really understood the current process, we moved on to figuring out what new features they might want. Knowing the system inside out was important here because it helped us figure out what could be improved. </p>
<p>Again, we talked to the people involved to get their thoughts, as we needed to focus on what they wanted. After we'd put together a detailed document of all the features they might want to add, along with reasons for each one, we moved on to see if each feature was doable. We looked at the big picture requirements and regulations that needed to be met, as well as the current systems in place and its limitations.</p>
<p>When the project is finished, we'll present our findings in a final report. The clients can then give this report to a new team if they decide to go ahead with our suggested features. This whole experience taught me how important it is to have a clear plan, work closely with clients, and truly understand a system before trying to make it better.
