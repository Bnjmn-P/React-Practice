      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am an undergraduate Computer Science student at AUT, majoring in Software Development. 
        I have experience working in hospitality and retail, in many different positions, which has given me a strong understanding of customer service and working collaboratively. I have taken on leadership roles in the past, but also enjoy being part of the team. I enjoy new experiences and using my knowledge base to excel in any environment or situation that comes my way. During University, I have taken on various projects in which I have developed problem-solving skills and technical abilities. I pride myself on my strong work ethic, passion, and motivation. .</p>
